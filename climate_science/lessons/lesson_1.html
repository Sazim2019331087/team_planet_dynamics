            üëã Hello! Welcome to Lesson 01! Let's explore climate science together!
        </div>
        <div class="dialog question">
            ü§î Do you know what climate science is?
        </div>
        <div class="dialog answer">
            üåç Sure! Climate science is a field that helps us understand how Earth‚Äôs systems function and how human activities impact these systems. With climate change being one of the most critical global challenges of our time, decoding the data and mechanisms behind it is essential for finding effective and sustainable solutions.
        </div>
        <div class="dialog question">
            üîç How does the climate system work?
        </div>
        <div class="dialog answer">
            The Earth's climate system is driven by energy from the Sun. A delicate balance exists between incoming solar radiation and outgoing heat, which defines our planet's climate. This energy is absorbed by the Earth's surface and radiated back into space. However, some of this heat is trapped by greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ), in the atmosphere. This process, known as the Greenhouse Effect, is vital for sustaining life on Earth, but human activities have intensified this effect, leading to significant changes in our climate.
        </div>
        <div class="dialog question">
            ‚ö†Ô∏è What has caused these changes in climate?
        </div>
        <div class="dialog answer">
            Over the past century, there has been a rapid increase in CO‚ÇÇ levels, primarily due to human activities like burning fossil fuels and deforestation. According to NASA‚Äôs Goddard Institute for Space Studies, CO‚ÇÇ levels have risen by more than 50% since the industrial revolution. This increase has resulted in alarming global temperature rises, more frequent extreme weather events, and accelerated melting of ice caps, significantly impacting ecosystems around the world.
        </div>
        <div class="dialog question">
            üöÄ What role does NASA play in climate science?
        </div>
        <div class="dialog answer">
            NASA employs advanced satellite technology to monitor and track changes in the Earth's atmosphere, oceans, and ice. Their Global Climate Change Vital Signs page provides real-time data on key indicators such as global temperatures, CO‚ÇÇ levels, and ice mass changes. One notable NASA mission is Aqua, which observes the water cycle by measuring the Earth's water vapor, cloud cover, and rainfall patterns. By analyzing these systems, scientists can create more accurate climate models to predict future changes and understand our planet better.
        </div>
        <div class="dialog question">
            ‚ú® Why is understanding climate science important?
        </div>
        <div class="dialog answer">
            Understanding climate science equips us to make informed decisions and take action to mitigate the impacts of climate change. By decoding the ‚Äúclimate code,‚Äù we can uncover the consequences of human activities on our environment and work towards sustainable practices that will preserve our planet for future generations. Are you ready to dive deeper into this fascinating subject?
